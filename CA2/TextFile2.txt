The 2022-23 European Rugby Champions Cup was the ninth season of the European Rugby Champions Cup, 
the annual club rugby union competition run by European Professional Club Rugby (EPCR) for teams from the top five nations in European rugby and South Africa. 
It was the twenty eighth season of pan-European professional club rugby competition.

Dutch beer brand Heineken continued as the title sponsor of the competition, 
extending their deal after their previous agreement expired at the end of the 2021-22 season.[1]
This was the first year to feature the top teams from South Africa, 
following the inaugural United Rugby Championship season.

The tournament commenced in December 2022. The final was held at Aviva Stadium in Dublin, 
Ireland on 20 May 2023.[2] The match was a repeat of the 2022 final, 
with Stade Rochelais defeating Leinster for the second consecutive year.[3]
